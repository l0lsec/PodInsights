PodInsights is a simple command-line tool that helps you transcribe podcast audio files and extract useful information from them. The current implementation relies on the [`faster-whisper`](https://github.com/guillaumekln/faster-whisper) library for transcription. Summarization and action item extraction are performed exclusively using OpenAI's chat models.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- [`faster-whisper`](https://github.com/guillaumekln/faster-whisper) installed for audio transcription
- [`openai`](https://pypi.org/project/openai/) and a valid `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable
- For the web interface: [`Flask`](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/), [`feedparser`](https://pypi.org/project/feedparser/), and [`requests`](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)
  (`sqlite3` from the standard library is used for episode tracking)

## Installation

### Setting Up a Virtual Environment

     ```

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables control authentication, model selection, and integration features:

### Required for All Modes

- **`OPENAI_API_KEY`** *(required)*: Your OpenAI API key. Required for all summarization and action item extraction features.

### Optional (Advanced Usage)

- **`OPENAI_MODEL`**: The OpenAI model to use for summarization, action item extraction, and article generation (default: `gpt-4o`). Set this if you want to use a different model.

### Required for JIRA Integration (Web UI)

- **`JIRA_BASE_URL`**: The base URL of your JIRA Cloud instance (e.g., `https://example.atlassian.net`).
- **`JIRA_EMAIL`**: The email address associated with your JIRA API token.
- **`JIRA_API_TOKEN`**: Your JIRA API token.
- **`JIRA_PROJECT_KEY`**: The project key where new issues should be created.

### Required for LinkedIn Integration (Web UI)

- **`LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID`**: Your LinkedIn app's Client ID from the [LinkedIn Developer Portal](https://www.linkedin.com/developers/).
- **`LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET`**: Your LinkedIn app's Client Secret.
- **`LINKEDIN_REDIRECT_URI`**: The OAuth callback URL (default: `http://localhost:5001/linkedin/callback`). Must match the redirect URI configured in your LinkedIn app.

### Required for Threads Integration (Web UI)

- **`THREADS_APP_ID`**: Your Threads app's App ID from the [Meta Developer Portal](https://developers.facebook.com/).
- **`THREADS_APP_SECRET`**: Your Threads app's App Secret.
- **`THREADS_REDIRECT_URI`**: The OAuth callback URL (must be HTTPS, e.g., `https://your-domain.com/threads/callback`). Must match the redirect URI configured in your Meta app.

### Optional for Web UI

- **`PORT`**: The port for the Flask web server (default: `5001`). Set this if you want the web UI to run on a different port.
- **`LINKEDIN_SCOPES`**: OAuth scopes for LinkedIn (default: `openid profile w_member_social`). Only change if you have specific scope requirements.

## Usage (CLI)

```bash
python podinsights.py path/to/podcast.mp3
```

The script will attempt to transcribe the audio file using `faster-whisper`, then ask OpenAI to produce a short summary and extract action items. Results are also written to a JSON file next to the audio by default. You can specify a custom output path with the `--json` option. Use `--verbose` to enable debug logging.
Progress messages are printed to the terminal so you can follow each step of the process.

> **Note**: If the `faster-whisper` package is not installed, the script will raise a `NotImplementedError`. Install all dependencies via `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
> **Note**: Summarization and action item extraction require OpenAI access. Ensure `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in your environment.

The JSON file contains three fields:

- `transcript` – the full transcript of the audio
- `summary` – the generated summary text
- `action_items` – a list of extracted action items

## Usage (Web UI)

A lightweight Flask application is provided in `podinsights_web.py`. It allows you to enter a podcast RSS feed URL, list the available episodes, and process an episode directly from your browser. Make sure you've installed dependencies from `requirements.txt`, then run:

```bash
python podinsights_web.py
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:5001` and add an RSS feed URL. Stored feeds are listed on the home page so you can return to them later. Selecting a feed shows the episodes along with their processing status.
When you process an episode a small overlay indicates progress until the results are displayed.
The episode description is shown at the top of the results page so you have context when reviewing the summary and action items. The full transcript is also available on the page in a collapsible section for reference.

Episode descriptions and any images provided by the feed are displayed next to each title to help you identify episodes before processing.

You can listen to any episode directly from the browser. Each episode row now includes a small audio player so you can preview the content before processing or reviewing tickets.

Processed episodes are stored in a local SQLite database (`episodes.db`). Each episode records the transcript, summary, and action items. The feed view reports whether these pieces of information have been extracted.


### Generating Articles

Transform podcast insights into polished articles for your blog or publication. After processing an episode, use the **Generate Article** section to create content focused on specific topics like cybersecurity, privacy, or emerging technology trends.

1. Process a podcast episode to get the transcript and summary
2. Scroll to the "Generate Article" section
3. Enter a topic or angle (e.g., "Privacy implications of AI voice assistants")
4. Select an article style:
   - **Blog Post** - Conversational and engaging
   - **News Article** - Factual and objective reporting
   - **Opinion/Editorial** - Analysis with perspective
   - **Technical Deep-Dive** - Detailed for practitioners
5. Click **Generate Article**

All generated articles are saved and can be accessed from the **Articles** page in the navigation.

### Creating JIRA Tickets

You can create JIRA issues directly from the action items listed on the result
page. Set the following environment variables so the web app can access your
JIRA Cloud instance:

- `JIRA_BASE_URL` – e.g. `https://example.atlassian.net`
- `JIRA_EMAIL` – the email associated with an API token
- `JIRA_API_TOKEN` – your JIRA API token
- `JIRA_PROJECT_KEY` – project key for new issues

Select the action items you want to track and click **Create JIRA Tickets**.
Created issues are stored locally so you can access them later. When viewing an
episode's results the associated JIRA tickets are listed with links. A dedicated
"Tickets" page in the web interface lists every issue that has been created.

Each created ticket includes context about where the action item came from. The
description notes the podcast episode title and includes the generated summary
so your team has immediate background when reviewing the issue.

Ticket status is fetched directly from JIRA whenever you view the tickets page
or the list of tickets on an episode's results page, so you can quickly see
whether items are still open or have been resolved.

The web interface also provides a **Status** page listing all queued and processed episodes from every feed. Use the **Queue** link next to an episode to process it in the background and track its progress on the Status page.
